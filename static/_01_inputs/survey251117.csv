You are invited to participate in a research study aimed at identifying gaps and opportunities for improving design tools, methodologies and guidelines to support sustainable cooling designs. You are being asked to complete an online survey that explores design approaches and tools used by practitioners to implement natural cooling strategies in buildings. 

 
The main objectives for the survey are to:

1. Understand which performance indicators, rules-of-thumb, and design tools practitioners are currently using to integrate natural cooling into their designs.

2. Understand the limitations of the current generation of design tools and guidelines.

3. Gauge interest in a prototype of a new modeling tool for natural cooling design.



TIME INVOLVEMENT

Your participation will take approximately 10 to 20 minutes.



RISKS AND BENEFITS

There are no risks associated with this study. There are also no direct benefits expected to result from this study. The benefits that may reasonably be expected to result from this study are greater knowledge about current design approaches, barriers and opportunities related to the use of natural cooling strategies in building design. Study data will be stored securely, in compliance with Stanford University standards, minimizing the risk of confidentiality breach. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study. 



PAYMENTS:

The reason why I don't see much use to this tool for my professional work is because I didn't see any buoyancy on heat gain simulations.

It is a 98,000sf, two-story tilt up building ill-suited to natural ventilation due to its deep floor plate. VHP offices will occupy the second floor with some functions and additional meeting rooms on the ground floor. Most of the ground floor is ""warm shell"" for future tenants. The users wanted the project to be naturally ventilated. Due to many constraints, natural ventilation was pursued on the second floor only. 

(16) large roof monitors with operable windows were added to the roof, operable windows were installed in the upgraded windows all the way around the second floor, fans are located throughout the open office areas, and displacement ventilation strategies were utilized. Night flushing mode is controlled based on temperature, humidity, and air quality. User overrides by zone are possible during the occupied hours.",0.03125,QID59
